## To Do's

* Error handling in more places
* PropType handling for the components
* Add more tests
* __mocks__ files to be in JSON format instead of plain JS
* Integrated Sass with CSS variables, mixins, and other techniques
* Webpack optimizations
* State management

* Fuzzy filter search bar for the top 100
* Share on social media icon buttons over the cards
* Shared count on card footer
